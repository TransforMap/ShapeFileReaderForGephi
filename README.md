# ShapeFileReaderForGephi
A Java program to read shapefiles and turn them into a network format

Here's the binary: http://jaensen.github.io/ShapeFileReader-1.0-SNAPSHOT.zip

usage is as following:
`java -jar /path/to/ShapeFileReader-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar /path/to/shapefiles/shapefile.shp`

It runs. But with the files I tested so far (not too many) it only produced a empty output file.
The output is named the same as the input file but with a .csv extension and is stored in the same folder as the input file.
